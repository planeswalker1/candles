## Description

_This repository has been created in order to showcase a programming challenge about looping completed in JavaScript._

## challenge

You are in charge of the cake for your nephew's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of his total age. When he blows out the candles, heâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles he can successfully blow out.

For example, if your nephew is turning 4 years old, the cake will have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3, he will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.

**Function Description**

Create a function that returns an integer representing the number of candles he can blow out.

This function has the following parameters:

array: an array of integers representing candle heights

**Constraints**

1 <= array.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
1 <= array[i] <= 10<sup>7</sup>

**Output Format**

Print the number of candles that can be blown out on a new line.

**Sample Input**

```
candles([3, 2, 1, 3]);
```

**Sample Output**

```
2
```

**Explanation**

We have one candle of height 1, one candle of height 2, and two candles of height 3. Your nephew only blows out the tallest candles, meaning the candles where height = 3. Because there are 2 such candles, we print 2 on a new line.
